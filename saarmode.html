                            <p>
                                I have been into video games for a few years now and have grown a liking 
                                to rhythm games and FPS's specifically<br>
                                Coding has become an interest for me in the last 2 years and I am hoping to grow upon that<br>
                                So far I have been certified in Python and plan on becoming certified in more languanges soon!

                                <p>
                                    I have worked for a CPA for the last 2.5 years and recently got promoted to General Office Manager. 
                                    <br> I have recently applied to a few other jobs to both have another source of income, and gain more experience
                                    <br> I am planning to work with coding on the side until I get into college but
                                    <br>until then I will focus on school for the most part
