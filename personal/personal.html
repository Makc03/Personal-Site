            to rhythm games and FPS's specifically<br>
            Although anything that's fun to mess around with friends will is also a blast!

        <p>
            I have worked for a CPA for the last 2.5 years and recently got promoted to General Office Manager. 
            <br> I have recently applied to a few other jobs to both have another source of income, and gain more experience
            <br> I am planning to work with coding on the side until I get into college but
            <br>until then I will focus on school for the most part
